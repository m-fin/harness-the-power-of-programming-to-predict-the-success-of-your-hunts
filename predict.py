# Welcome, fellow hunter-gatherers, to the dawn of a new era where tradition meets the cutting-edge world of technology. Here's your guide on how you can harness the power of programming to predict the success of your hunts. With the wisdom of the ancients and the magic of modern science, discover how data and machine learning can become your most trusted allies in foreseeing the bounties of nature. Let's embark on this remarkable journey together, blending the old ways with the new, to ensure a prosperous hunt every time.

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# The wisdom of the ancients now encoded in data
# Let's pretend we have data on past hunts:
# Features: weather_conditions, time_of_year, moon_phase (encoded as integers)
# Target: hunt_success (1 for successful, 0 for not successful)
data = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3, 1],  # Example: Good weather, mid-year, full moon, successful hunt
    [2, 3, 1, 0],  # Bad weather, end of year, new moon, unsuccessful hunt
    # ... more data
])

# Splitting the mystic data into the elements (features) and the prophecy (outcome)
X = data[:, :-1]  # All rows, all columns except the last
y = data[:, -1]   # All rows, just the last column

# Splitting the ancient records into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Invoking the forest of decision trees to predict the outcome of the hunt
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the success of tomorrow's hunt based on the wisdom of past hunts
# Example conditions for tomorrow: Good weather, mid-year, full moon
tomorrow_hunt = np.array([[1, 2, 3]])
prediction = model.predict(tomorrow_hunt)

if prediction == 1:
    print("The path is clear, the hunt will be bountiful!")
else:
    print("Caution is wise, the signs point to a challenging hunt.")

# The hunter-gatherer, awed by the power of their discovery
print("With these sacred scripts, I can foresee the unseen, guided by the patterns of old.")
